Scott KB2EAR maintains a repository of custom node IDs taht can be downloaded to a node and when you connect to or get a connect from one of these nodes, you get a custom message.
These are the notes from Scott slightly edited.

Add this line to your crontab

00 00,12 * * * /usr/bin/rsync -av rsync://reflector.kb2ear.net/nodenames/ /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/rpt/nodenames/

By using rsync your system will only get files that are newer than the ones already there, keeping my bandwidth usage down.

To add your node to the repository go to:
<http://reflector.kb2ear.net/ubr_file_upload.php>

Make sure your file is named <nodenumber>.wav,gsm,ulaw

If it tells you the file is not allowed email it to me and I'll fix the upload.

If you have a large number of files zip them up and then upload.

Or just email me the files.

once I test the file to make sure it plays in asterisk I'll add it to the repository for everyone to download.

Scott KB2EAR
